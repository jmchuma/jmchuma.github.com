Hello there! Welcome to my lair. This is the git repository for my
website.

# My name is&hellip;
Well, for the time being I only use my first name for legal stuff. I
simply go by my family names: Chumo Mata.

# More about me?
I earned a degree in Computer Science—or Computer Engineering, I am not
really sure how to translate Ingeniería Informática—at Universidad
Carlos III de Madrid, in Spain. I mainly work as an Enghlish teacher
and actor. And I am also an aspiring director. For the time being I am
just experimenting, but a man can dream, though. A man can dream.

# To build the site I use&hellip;
Vim, Jekyll&hellip; and time.

# Why do I need a README in this repo anyways?
For future reference. To have a list of things I plan implement on the
website and to store the pages I check to build it, in case that may
come in handy for me or someone else.

# TODO
## For sure
* Check if
  [this](https://www.sylvaindurand.org/making-jekyll-multilingual/)
  is a better option to make the site multilingual.
* Change how I generate the [navigation menu](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/navigation/).
* Stuff I want to do add after checking [htmlhead](https://htmlhead.dev/)
    * Add meta with description in pages.
    * Add meta for robots to control the behavior of search engines crawling and indexing the site.
    * Add link alternate for translations.
* Make it look good on mobile.
    * [Viewport](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag) at MDN.
    * [CSS Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries)
      at MDN.

## Maybe
* Stuff I may add after checking [htmlhead](https://htmlhead.dev/)
  * Add meta with generator?
  * Add link with author?
